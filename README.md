# Practice_It - https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/problem/list

This repository is designed to store the solutions that I have done for the Pratice It website. This website is used by many students at the University of Washington in the intro computer science courses to learn and pratice algoirthms and data structures using Java. Notable chapters include: 

* ArrayLists
* Recurrsion
* LinkedLists
* Trees
* Stacks and Queues
* Collections (HashMaps, Sets, Sorting)

The purpose of this repository is to show the pratice I have done with Java and to highlight the work to get better and faster at coding in general.

## Instructions to Run

To run these programs, please use the this link: https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/problem/list

Once you are logged in, go to the most current edition and search for the chapter that is noted. Open the problem that you want in both this GitHub and Pratice it. Copy and paste the code from this GitHub to the coding window for that problem in Pratice It and press Control-s (CMD s for Macs) or press "Submit". 

## Next Steps
I hope to complete as many of the coding problems as possible and will continue to upload on a weekly basis as a way to get faster at typing code.
