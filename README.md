## Practice It - https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/problem/list
This repository is designed to store my solutions for the Pratice It website. This website, made by Marty Stepp and other UW Facalty, is used by many students at the University of Washington and Bellevue College in the introductory computer science courses. Many students continue to use this website as a way to learn and pratice coding, algoirthms, and data structures using Java. #Notable chapters include:#

* ArrayLists                
* Trees
* Recurrsion
* LinkedLists
* Stacks and Queues
* Collections (HashMaps, Sets, Sorting)

The purpose of this repository is to show the pratice I have done with Java and to highlight the work to get better and faster at coding in general.

### Instructions to Run
To run these programs, please use the this link: https://practiceit.cs.washington.edu/problem/list

Once you are logged in, go to the most current edition and search for the chapter that is noted. Open the problem that you want in both this GitHub and Pratice it. Copy and paste the code from this GitHub to the coding window for that problem in Pratice It and press Control-s (CMD s for Macs) or press "Submit". 

### Next Steps
I hope to complete as many of the coding problems as possible and will continue to upload on a weekly basis as a way to get faster at typing code.
